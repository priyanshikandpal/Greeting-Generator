# Greeting-Generator
This single-page application demonstrates the use of Next.js server actions with Shadcn UI components. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. **User Interaction**:

1. The user enters their name in the input field and clicks the submit button
2. The form data is sent to the server via a server action
3. The server processes the input and returns a greeting message
4. The greeting is displayed below the form



2. **Key Components**:

1. `app/actions.ts`: Contains the server action that processes the form data
2. `components/greeting-form.tsx`: Client component with the form and result display
3. `components/explanation-section.tsx`: Explains how the application works
4. `app/page.tsx`: Main page that brings everything together



3. **Technical Features**:

1. Server Actions for processing form submissions
2. React Server Components for improved performance
3. Client Components for interactive elements
4. TypeScript for type safety
5. Responsive design for all device sizes





The application is fully responsive and demonstrates modern Next.js patterns with Shadcn UI components for a polished user experience.
